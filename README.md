Numpy library for mathematical computation. Matplotlib library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualization in Python. API keys are store in evnviroment file (not available in github). Alpaca public APIs used to prepare the historical data for forcasting and analysis. Path library is used to identify the path of files.
